## Webcast

In the year 2017 we have started with a new webcast series for you, called “iCSD - Stuff That Matters” (thanks to Maurice Driessen for the great name). The idea is to organize webcasts dealing with topics which seem relevant for the community related with devonfw and OASP. Each session is planned for half an hour up to an hour with reserved time for Q&A. There, you will be able to ask anything related to the topic or iCSD in general.

We started with a highly attended first session the 27th of January 2017 by Angel Marin from Capgemini Spain (Valencia) about “Dealing with Complexity on the Front End”. Angel took a look at one of our front-end options provided by devonfw: Devon4sencha. This framework is based on Sencha Ext JS, a powerful JavaScript framework for creating rich web applications. He showed how it makes it easy to deal with usually complex user interface patterns and during the session he explored some of the tools it provides. There was time for Q&A and people did not hesitate to ask anything that came to their mind.

A second session was held the 24th of February by Jonas Molina Ramirez from Capgemini Germany (Frankfurt) about “Testing with OASP4j”. During his his talk Jonas investigated the testing facilities currently provided by OASP4j and he showed those features which aid you with the following:

Focus on test logic instead of infrastructure
Manage your test data
Configure your tests
The edited video of this talk has been uploaded to Teamforge and can be found in the Server section. It will be included soon in the devonfw Catalog in the 360 learning platform.

The third episode, held on beginning of April, dealt with the ins and outs of Cobigen, the code generator in devonfw. The Webcasts are definitely meant to be open. So, as always, you are very welcome to propose certain topics and / or present a topic yourself.

The latest webcast held on 28th of July was all about Courage, the newest version of devonfw (2.2). Some demos were shown, as well as what's new and what has changed.
